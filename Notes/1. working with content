There are 4 parts of React component file:
1. Import libraries we need to create a component
2. Create a component - a function that returns some 'JSX'
3. Create a styesheet to style our component.
4. Export the component so we can use elsewhere in our project. 

============================================================================

Rules of JSX
1, We can assemble different JSX elements like normal HTML
2. We configure different JSX elements using 'props'
3. We can refer toJS variables inside of a JSX block by using curly braces
4. We can assign JSX elements to a variable, then show that variable inside of a JSX block
